# Question 5
# You are a cook in a busy restaurant. You are writing a program to help you organize how much of each kind of food you need to cook. Naturally,
# you decide to take a break from cooking and write a function to help. You decide that your function will take a dictionary as a parameter where the keys
# are the tables in the restaurant and the values are lists of strings describing the food each table has ordered.
# Your function returns a dictionary with the totals for how many of each food item you need to cook.
#
# For example, say you have 5 tables and 3 dishes:
# Tables: t1, t2, t3, t4 and t5
# Dishes: Vegetarian stew, Steak pie, Poutine
#
# Input:
#
# You will use the table names as the keys, and use a list of the foods ordered at each table as values.
#
# For example your dictionary may look like this:
#
# {'t1': ['Vegetarian stew', 'Poutine', 'Vegetarian stew'],
#  't3': ['Steak pie', 'Poutine', 'Vegetarian stew'],
#  't4': ['Steak pie', 'Steak pie']}
#
# Output:
#
# Your function must return a dictionary with the dish as the key, and the number of times that dish was ordered as the value. Given the above input,
# your function would create and return a dictionary equivalent to the following:
#
# {'Vegetarian stew': 3, 'Poutine': 2, 'Steak pie': 3}
