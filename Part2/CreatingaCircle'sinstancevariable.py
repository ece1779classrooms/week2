# Question 1
# Complete method __init__ in the following class. (It's only missing an assignment to a radius instance variable.)


class Circle:
    # """ A circle with a radius. """

    def __init__(self, r: int) -> None:
        # """Create a circle with a radius r.

        # >>> c = Circle(10)
        # >>> c.radius
        # 10
